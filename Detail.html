    <h1>Detail Description about Nature</h1>
    <p>Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another.</p>
    <p>
        Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing, among other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to the planetâ€™s beauty. Along with humans, animals and birds also find their habitat and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is essential to take proper care of our nature to maintain a healthy life. <br>
        When we observe and feel the beauty of nature it has such a tranquil and soothing effect on our mind, body and soul. It has a lasting effect on our senses and gives an amazing feeling of refreshment and delight. When we think of the beauty of nature we immediately think of the scenic and visual beauty of nature, like the soaring mountains, tranquil rivers, greeneries of trees, colors of rainbow, butterflies and birds, and the blossoming flowers. Everything about nature gives us the feeling of pleasure.
